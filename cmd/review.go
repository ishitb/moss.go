// reviewCmd represents the review command
var reviewCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "review",
	Short: "Send files for review",
	Long: `
	Usage Instructions:
		The -l option specifies the source language of the tested programs.
		Moss supports many different languages; see below for the
		full list.
		["c", "cc", "java", "ml", "pascal", "ada", "lisp", "scheme", "haskell", "fortran", "ascii", "vhdl", "perl", "matlab", "python", "mips", "prolog", "spice", "vb", "csharp", "modula2", "a8086", "javascript", "plsql"]
		Example: Compare the lisp programs foo.lisp and bar.lisp:
			moss -l lisp foo.lisp bar.lisp
	
		The -d option specifies that submissions are by directory, not by file.
		That is, files in a directory are taken to be part of the same program,
		and reported matches are organized accordingly by directory.
		Example: Compare the programs foo and bar, which consist of .c and .h
		files in the directories foo and bar respectively.
			moss -d foo/*.c foo/*.h bar/*.c bar/*.h
			
		Example: Each program consists of the *.c and *.h files in a directory under
		the directory "assignment1."
			moss -d assignment1/*/*.h assignment1/*/*.c

		The -b option names a "base file". When a base file is supplied,
		program code that also appears in the base file is not counted in matches.
		A typical base file will include, for example, the instructor-supplied 
		IMPORTANT: Unlike previous versions of moss, the -b option *always*
		takes a single filename, even if the -d option is also used.
		Examples: Submit all of the C++ files in the current directory, using skeleton.cc
		as the base file:
			moss -l cc -b skeleton.cc *.cc
		Submit all of the ML programs in directories asn1.96/* and asn1.97/*, where
		asn1.97/instructor/example.ml and asn1.96/instructor/example.ml contain the base files.
			moss -l ml -b asn1.97/instructor/example.ml -b asn1.96/instructor/example.ml -d asn1.97/*/*.ml asn1.96/*/*.ml 
		
		
		The -m option sets the maximum number of times a given passage may appear
		before it is ignored.  A passage of code that appears in many programs
		is probably legitimate sharing and not the result of plagiarism.  With -m N,
		any passage appearing in more than N programs is treated as if it appeared in 
		a base file (i.e., it is never reported). The default for -m is 10.
		Examples:
			moss -l pascal -m 2 *.pascal 
			moss -l cc -m 1000000 -b mycode.cc asn1/*.cc
		
		The -c option supplies a comment string that is attached to the generated
		report.
		Example:
			moss -l scheme -c "Scheme programs" *.sch
		
		The -n option determines the number of matching files to show in the results.
		The default is 250.
		Example:
			moss -c java -n 200 *.java
		
		The -x option sends queries to the current experimental version of the server.
		Example:
			moss -x -l ml *.ml
